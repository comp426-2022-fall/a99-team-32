# Weatherfy

## Summary 

Weatherfy is a web app that allows you to search for a location's weather in real-time. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to receive weather data from cities across the world. You will be able to see several weather varibles, including the real temperature, what it "feels like", weather conditions (like clouds, rain, clear sky), cloudcover, humidity, windspeed, sunrise, and sunset. 

## Our App

### Video Walkthrough

team will create a <= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app. This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else. Be creative. Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).

### Instructions for Use

1. Clone repository
2. Run npm install inside directory to install dependencies
3. Run **npm test** or **npm start** (node server.js) to start app
4. Search localhost:4000 on webbrowser (it listens on port 4000)
5. Click “LOG IN” for the login page
6. Put in username and password to login
7. Search for the real-time weather of the city
